# Hello-World
Just a Repository
Hi 
Deepthi here, I completed my masters in cs with distinction in the year 2017.
As my interest i decided to start my carrer as hadoop developer and successfully completed my course from asterix solutions, Thane.

I have several strengths namely – I am committed, honest and self-motivated. I am the biggest dreamer. I forgive easily and hate to keep grudges in my heart. My greatest weakness is that I don't like getting interrupted when I am seriously into something. Another one of my weaknesses is that I trust people very easily.I am actively working on this lacuna.”
